## Introduction

In the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) process, roughly a 2mm spherical shell made of high-density carbon is used as a target for laser beams, 
which compress and heat it to energy levels needed for high fusion yield. These shells are polished meticulously to meet the standards for a fusion shot. 
However, the polishing of these shells involves multiple stages, with each stage taking several hours. 
To make sure that the polishing process is advancing in the right direction, we are able to measure the shell surface roughness. 
This measurement, however, is very labor-intensive, time-consuming, and requires a human operator. 
To help improve the polishing process we have released the first dataset to the public that consists of raw vibration signals with the corresponding polishing surface roughness changes. 
We show that this dataset can be used with a variety of deep learning methods for prediction of the change of polishing surface roughness. 
This is the first dataset of each kind to be released in public and its use will allow the operator to make any necessary changes to the polishing for optimal result. 
This dataset contains the raw vibration data of multiple polishing runs with their extracted statistical features or their extracted frequency domain bands. 
We also provide some baselines with Neural Networks and Domain Adaptation techniques where we observe that domain adaptation performs better.
